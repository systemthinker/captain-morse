The original version of this app can be found at https://github.com/tdijkmans/morse-code-masters and is made By Thomas Dijkmans and myself Robbert van den Outenaar. This version which you are looking now is made to have a copy on my own Github page. With that said, enjoy!
# What this app is about
Captain Morse is a little word-guessing game using Morse Code. The app outlines the imaginative situation where Captain Morse is on his boat and sinking due to a storm. Signaling 'SOS' in Morse Code does not work ( ... ___ ...) - so the urgent riddle is: which message does work to the lives of Captain Morse and his crew.

*** note: The only browser that currently supports this app is Google Chrome, this is due voice recognition software.

#### Goals of this project
As part of Codaisseur's web development bootcamp an assignment was given: build an app, in team of fellow students, in one week, given the theme 'Language and letters'.

### Tech used in the project
ReactJS for UI building (frontend only, no backend)
the built-in web brower speech recognition engine for converting speech to transcript
JS functions to convert transcripts to morse code
the built-in tone generator to output Morse Code in sound
timed displaying of 4 PNG images to render synchronous Morse Code 'flashing'

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
