The original version of this app can be found at https://github.com/tdijkmans/morse-code-masters and is made By Thomas Dijkmans and myself Robbert van den Outenaar. This version which you are looking now is made to have a copy on my own Github page. With that said, enjoy!
# What this app is about
Captain Morse is a little word-guessing game using Morse Code. The app outlines the imaginative situation where Captain Morse is on his boat and sinking due to a storm. Signaling 'SOS' in Morse Code does not work ( ... ___ ...) - so the urgent riddle is: which message does work to the lives of Captain Morse and his crew.

*** note: The only browser that currently supports this app is Google Chrome, this is due voice recognition software.

#### Goals of this project
As part of Codaisseur's web development bootcamp an assignment was given: build an app, in team of fellow students, in one week, given the theme 'Language and letters'.

### Tech used in the project
ReactJS for UI building (frontend only, no backend)
the built-in web brower speech recognition engine for converting speech to transcript
JS functions to convert transcripts to morse code
the built-in tone generator to output Morse Code in sound
timed displaying of 4 PNG images to render synchronous Morse Code 'flashing'
